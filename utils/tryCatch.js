 //When you use await inside the controller function, the asynchronous operation(like a db
// query,file reads, or HTTP requests) is awaited within the controller, meaning the
// controller will wait for the asynchronous operation to finish before proceeding to
// the next line.
// However, if the controller itself (which returns a Promise as it is async) is not 
// awaited in the tryCatch wrapper, the try-catch in the wrapper will not be able to catch 
// errors that occur during the asynchronous execution. The wrapper will return immediately,
// without waiting for the controllerâ€™s Promise to resolve or reject.
